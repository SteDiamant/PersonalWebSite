I'm also into data analytics and business, with a Minor in Business and Data Analytics. Recently, I had an amazing time at Berkeley University too!

Before all this, I studied physics at the University of Thessaloniki. Beyond academics, I've had hands-on experiences with supply chain data, hardware setups, and more.

I'm super pumped about the future, where engineering, data, and business collide! Let's rock this journey together and make a splash in the world! ðŸš€ðŸ˜„""")
